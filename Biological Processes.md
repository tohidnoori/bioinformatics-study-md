### üìò Notes
- Each biological process is defined and maintained by the **Gene Ontology Consortium (GOC)**.  
- GO terms provide a **standardized vocabulary** to describe what genes *do*, *why they do it*, and *where they act*.  
- You can explore these terms interactively using:
  - üß≠ [AmiGO Browser](http://amigo.geneontology.org/)
