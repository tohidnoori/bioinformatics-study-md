# RNA Polymerization (Transcription)

## Definition
**RNA polymerization**, also known as **transcription**, is the **biological process** by which the **genetic information in DNA** is **copied into [RNA](./rna.md)** .  

This process is essential for **gene expression**, because RNA serves as the **intermediate molecule** that carries genetic instructions from DNA to the machinery that builds proteins.

In short:
> DNA → RNA → Protein

---

## Purpose of RNA Polymerization
- Converts **genetic information** in DNA into **RNA** (especially messenger RNA, or mRNA).
- Allows genes to be **expressed** without risking damage to the DNA itself.
- Produces other RNAs too — like **rRNA** and **tRNA**, which are essential for protein synthesis.

---

## Site of Occurrence
- **In eukaryotic cells:** Occurs in the **nucleus**.
- **In prokaryotic cells:** Occurs in the **cytoplasm**, since there is no nucleus.

---

## Main Enzyme: RNA Polymerase
The key enzyme that performs RNA polymerization is **[RNA polymerase](./rna-topic.md#4-rna-polymerase)**.
It binds to DNA, separates the strands, and builds an RNA copy based on the DNA template strand.

## Stages of RNA Polymerization (Transcription)

### 1. Initiation
This is the **starting phase** of transcription.

#### Steps:
1. **RNA polymerase** binds to a specific DNA sequence called the **promoter**.
2. In eukaryotes, several **transcription factors** help RNA polymerase locate and attach to the promoter.
3. The **DNA double helix unwinds**, exposing the **template strand**.
4. The **first RNA nucleotides** are linked together.

#### Key Concepts to Explore:
- Promoter regions  
- Transcription factors  
- Role of RNA polymerase II  


### 2. Elongation
During elongation, the **RNA strand is synthesized**.

#### Steps:
1. RNA polymerase moves along the **template DNA strand** in the **3′ → 5′ direction**.
2. It adds complementary **ribonucleotides** to the growing RNA strand in the **5′ → 3′ direction**.
3. The RNA strand **grows in length**, detaching from the DNA as it is formed.
4. Behind the enzyme, the DNA helix **re-forms**.

#### Key Concepts to Explore:
- Base pairing (A–U, T–A, G–C, C–G)  
- Energy from nucleotide triphosphates  
- Transcription bubble (open region of DNA)



### 3. Termination
This is the **final phase** of transcription.

#### Steps:
1. RNA polymerase reaches a **termination sequence** on the DNA.
2. The enzyme **releases the newly formed RNA** and detaches from the DNA template.
3. The **DNA rewinds** into its double-helix structure.

#### Key Concepts to Explore:
- Termination signals  
- Differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic termination

## Post-Transcriptional Events (Eukaryotes Only)
In **eukaryotic cells**, the initial RNA transcript made by RNA polymerase II is called **pre-mRNA**.  
It must be **processed** before it becomes mature mRNA that can be translated into protein.

### Main Modifications:
1. **[5′ Capping](./rna-topic.md#1-the-5-cap-five-prime-cap)** – A protective cap is added to the beginning of RNA.  
2. **[Splicing](./rna-topic.md#3-rna-splicing)** – Non-coding introns are removed, and coding exons are joined.  
3. **3′ Polyadenylation** – A poly-A tail is added for stability and export.  
4. **[RNA Motifs](./rna-topic.md#2-rna-motifs)** – Specific patterns in RNA that influence structure, stability, and protein binding.

## Direction of Synthesis
RNA is always synthesized:
- **From 5′ to 3′ direction** (the new nucleotides are added to the 3′ end)
- Using the **DNA template strand** that is read **3′ to 5′**

## Products of RNA Polymerization

| RNA Type | Made by | Function |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| **mRNA (messenger RNA)** | RNA Polymerase II | Carries genetic code to ribosomes |
| **rRNA (ribosomal RNA)** | RNA Polymerase I | Structural and catalytic part of ribosomes |
| **tRNA (transfer RNA)** | RNA Polymerase III | Transfers amino acids during translation |
| **snRNA, miRNA, etc.** | RNA Polymerase II/III | Regulate gene expression and RNA processing |

## Importance of RNA Polymerization
- It is the **first and most regulated step** of gene expression.
- Errors in transcription can lead to incorrect or nonfunctional proteins.
- Controls how much and when a gene is expressed — essential for **cell differentiation** and **function**.
