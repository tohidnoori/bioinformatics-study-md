# Gene

A **gene** is a specific sequence of **DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid)** that contains the **instructions for making a functional product**, usually a **protein** or sometimes a **functional RNA** (like tRNA, rRNA, or miRNA).

Genes are the **basic units of heredity**, meaning they are passed from parents to offspring and determine many traits, such as eye color, blood type, and enzyme activity.

In simple terms:
> A **gene** is a "code" within DNA that tells the cell how to build and regulate proteins.


## Location and Structure of Genes

### Where Genes Are Found
- In **eukaryotes** (plants, animals, fungi): genes are located in the **nucleus**, on **chromosomes** made of DNA and proteins (histones).
- In **prokaryotes** (bacteria): genes are located in a **single circular DNA molecule** in the cytoplasm.
- Some genes also exist in **organelles** like **mitochondria** and **chloroplasts** (called extranuclear or organellar genes).


## Basic Structure of a Gene

A gene is not just a continuous piece of DNA—it has **specific regions** that control when, where, and how a gene is expressed.

| Gene Region | Description |
|--------------|--------------|
| **Promoter** | The control region before the gene; signals RNA polymerase where to start transcription. |
| **Exons** | Coding segments that will appear in the final mRNA and be translated into protein. |
| **Introns** | Non-coding segments within genes; removed during RNA splicing. |
| **Terminator** | Sequence signaling the end of transcription. |
| **Regulatory Sequences** | Regions (enhancers, silencers) that control how strongly or when a gene is expressed. |

## Composition of a Gene

Genes are made of **nucleotides**, which have:
- **Sugar (deoxyribose)**
- **Phosphate group**
- **Nitrogen base** (A, T, G, C)

The **order of these bases** forms the **genetic code**.

## How Genes Work — The Central Dogma of Molecular Biology

The function of a gene is to provide **instructions for building proteins** through two major processes:

1. **Transcription**  
   - The DNA sequence of the gene is copied into **mRNA** by the enzyme **RNA polymerase**.
   - This happens in the **nucleus** (in eukaryotes).

2. **Translation**  
   - The mRNA leaves the nucleus and goes to a **ribosome**.
   - The ribosome reads the mRNA sequence and assembles **amino acids** into a protein according to the genetic code.

This process can be summarized as:

**DNA → RNA → Protein**

## The Genetic Code

The **genetic code** is the set of rules that defines how the sequence of nucleotides in mRNA is translated into amino acids.

- Every group of **three nucleotides** (a **codon**) corresponds to **one amino acid**.
- Example:  
  - DNA: `TAC GAA CTT`  
  - mRNA: `AUG CUU GAA`  
  - Amino acids: `Methionine – Leucine – Glutamic acid`
- The code is **universal** (almost all living organisms use the same code).

## Types of Genes

| Type | Function |
|------|-----------|
| **Protein-coding genes** | Contain information to make proteins. |
| **rRNA genes** | Encode ribosomal RNA, a structural part of ribosomes. |
| **tRNA genes** | Encode transfer RNA, which brings amino acids to the ribosome. |
| **miRNA / siRNA genes** | Encode small RNAs that regulate gene expression. |
| **Pseudogenes** | Non-functional copies of genes that have lost their ability to code for proteins. |


## Regulatory Elements and Gene Expression

Gene expression is tightly controlled so that genes are turned **on** or **off** at the right time.

| Element | Function |
|----------|-----------|
| **Promoter** | Binding site for RNA polymerase; determines transcription start. |
| **Enhancer** | Increases transcription when activated by specific proteins. |
| **Silencer** | Decreases transcription; turns genes off. |
| **Operator (in prokaryotes)** | Region that interacts with repressors to control operons. |

Example:  
In bacteria, a group of genes that work together can be organized into an **operon** (like the **lac operon**).

## Alleles

Each gene can have different **versions**, called **alleles**, that produce variations in a trait.

- Example: The **eye color gene** might have a “brown” allele and a “blue” allele.
- Humans inherit **two alleles** for each gene (one from each parent).


## Genome, Genes, and Chromosomes

| Level | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **DNA** | The molecule that carries all genetic information. |
| **Gene** | A segment of DNA that codes for a specific product. |
| **Chromosome** | A long DNA molecule containing many genes. |
| **Genome** | The complete set of all genes in an organism. |

Humans have:
- **~20,000 to 25,000 genes**
- **46 chromosomes** (23 pairs)
- **3 billion base pairs** of DNA

## Mutations and Gene Variations

A **mutation** is a change in the DNA sequence of a gene.  
Mutations can:
- **Change** the protein produced.
- **Deactivate** the gene.
- **Have no effect** (silent mutation).

Types of mutations:
- **Substitution** (one base replaced)
- **Insertion** (extra base added)
- **Deletion** (base removed)
- **Duplication / Inversion / Translocation** (larger rearrangements)

Some mutations cause **genetic diseases** (e.g., sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis).

## Epigenetic Control of Genes

Not all gene regulation is due to DNA sequence.  
**Epigenetics** involves chemical modifications that affect gene activity without changing DNA sequence.

Examples:
- **DNA methylation** (turns genes off)
- **Histone modification** (controls DNA packing and access)

These changes can be influenced by **environment, diet, and stress**, and may even be **inherited**.
