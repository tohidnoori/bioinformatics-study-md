# Amino Acids

## What are Amino Acids?  
- **Amino acids** are the **building blocks of proteins**.  
- They are small organic molecules with the general structure:  

Where:  
- **H₂N (Amino group)** → basic part  
- **COOH (Carboxyl group)** → acidic part  
- **H** → hydrogen atom  
- **R (Side chain)** → variable group that gives each amino acid its unique chemical property  
- Amino acids are the **monomers of proteins**.  
- Their diversity comes from their **R groups**.  
- Categories:  
  - **Nonpolar (hydrophobic)**  
  - **Polar (uncharged)**  
  - **Acidic (– charge)**  
  - **Basic (+ charge)**  
- Special cases like **Proline, Glycine, Cysteine** play unique roles in protein structure.

## Classification of Amino Acids (by R-group properties)

### 1. Basic (Positively Charged at pH 7)  
- Extra amino group → can accept H⁺.

### 2. Acidic (Negatively Charged at pH 7)  
- Extra carboxyl group (–COOH) → can donate H⁺.
 
### 3. Nonpolar, Hydrophobic  
- Side chains are hydrocarbons → avoid water.  
- Often buried inside proteins.  

### 4. Polar, Uncharged  
- Side chains form hydrogen bonds but carry no charge.  
- Important in protein folding and interactions.
