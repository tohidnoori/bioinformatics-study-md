# Translation

**Translation** is the biological process in which the sequence of **nucleotides** in a messenger RNA (**mRNA**) molecule is decoded to produce a specific sequence of **amino acids** — forming a **protein**.  
This is the **second major step of gene expression**, following **transcription**, which produces the mRNA.

Translation takes place in the **cytoplasm**, specifically on the **ribosomes**, which are complex molecular machines made of **rRNA (ribosomal RNA)** and **proteins**.

### Central Dogma of Molecular Biology


- **Transcription:** DNA is transcribed into mRNA inside the nucleus (in eukaryotes).  
- **Translation:** mRNA is read by ribosomes in the cytoplasm to synthesize proteins.

## The Genetic Code

The **[genetic code](./gene.md)** is the set of rules by which information encoded in mRNA is translated into proteins.

- The mRNA sequence is read in groups of **three nucleotides** called **codons**.  
- Each **codon** corresponds to **one amino acid** or a **stop signal**.  
- The code is:
  - **Triplet-based:** 3 bases = 1 codon.
  - **Non-overlapping:** Codons are read one after another without overlap.
  - **Universal:** Nearly all organisms use the same code.
  - **Degenerate:** Most amino acids have more than one codon.

### The Standard Codon Table

| **Amino Acid** | **Codon 1** | **Codon 2** | **Codon 3** | **Codon 4** | **Codon 5** | **Codon 6** |
|----------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Phe (Phenylalanine)** | UUU | UUC |  |  |
| **Leu (Leucine)** | UUA | UUG | CUU | CUC | CUA | CUG | 
| **Ile (Isoleucine)** | AUU | AUC | AUA |  |
| **Met (Methionine - Start)** | AUG |  |  |  |
| **Val (Valine)** | GUU | GUC | GUA | GUG |
| **Ser (Serine)** | UCU | UCC | UCA | UCG | AGU | AGC |
| **Pro (Proline)** | CCU | CCC | CCA | CCG |
| **Thr (Threonine)** | ACU | ACC | ACA | ACG |
| **Ala (Alanine)** | GCU | GCC | GCA | GCG |
| **Tyr (Tyrosine)** | UAU | UAC |  |  |
| **Stop Codons** | UAA | UAG | UGA |  |
| **His (Histidine)** | CAU | CAC |  |  |
| **Gln (Glutamine)** | CAA | CAG |  |  |
| **Asn (Asparagine)** | AAU | AAC |  |  |
| **Lys (Lysine)** | AAA | AAG |  |  |
| **Asp (Aspartic Acid)** | GAU | GAC |  |  |
| **Glu (Glutamic Acid)** | GAA | GAG |  |  |
| **Cys (Cysteine)** | UGU | UGC |  |  |
| **Trp (Tryptophan)** | UGG |  |  |  |
| **Arg (Arginine)** | CGU | CGC | CGA | CGG | AGA | AGG |
| **Gly (Glycine)** | GGU | GGC | GGA | GGG |

> **Note:**  
> - **Start Codon:** AUG (codes for Methionine).  
> - **Stop Codons:** UAA, UAG, UGA.

## Major Molecules Involved

### 1. mRNA (Messenger RNA)
- Carries genetic information from DNA to ribosomes.
- Contains codons that determine the amino acid sequence.

### 2. tRNA (Transfer RNA)
- Each tRNA molecule carries a specific amino acid.
- It has an **anticodon** that is complementary to an mRNA codon.
- Example: If mRNA codon = `AUG`, tRNA anticodon = `UAC`.

### 3. Ribosomes
- The site of protein synthesis.  
- Composed of:
  - **Small subunit:** Binds mRNA.
  - **Large subunit:** Catalyzes peptide bond formation.  
- Has three binding sites:
  - **A site (Aminoacyl):** Holds the incoming tRNA.
  - **P site (Peptidyl):** Holds the tRNA carrying the growing polypeptide chain.
  - **E site (Exit):** Where empty tRNA exits the ribosome.

### 4. Aminoacyl-tRNA Synthetases
- Enzymes that attach the correct amino acid to its corresponding tRNA.
- Ensures that each codon in the mRNA brings in the correct amino acid.

## Stages of Translation

Translation occurs in **three main stages**:

### 1. Initiation

1. The **small ribosomal subunit** binds to the **mRNA** near the **start codon (AUG)**.
2. The **initiator tRNA**, carrying **methionine**, binds to AUG via complementary base pairing.
3. The **large ribosomal subunit** joins the complex, forming a complete **ribosome**.
4. The initiator tRNA occupies the **P site** — the ribosome is now ready to elongate the peptide chain.

### 2. Elongation

1. A **new tRNA** carrying an amino acid enters the **A site**, matching the mRNA codon with its anticodon.
2. A **peptide bond** forms between the amino acid in the **A site** and the growing chain in the **P site**.  
   - This reaction is catalyzed by **peptidyl transferase**, a ribozyme function of the ribosome’s rRNA.
3. The ribosome then **moves one codon forward** (a process called **translocation**).
   - The tRNA in the **P site** moves to the **E site** and exits.
   - The tRNA in the **A site** moves to the **P site**, carrying the growing chain.
4. This process repeats, elongating the polypeptide chain one amino acid at a time.

### 3. Termination

1. When a **stop codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA)** enters the **A site**, no tRNA matches it.
2. A **release factor protein** binds to the stop codon.
3. The completed **polypeptide** is released from the tRNA in the **P site**.
4. The **ribosome subunits** separate and can be reused for new rounds of translation.

## After Translation

Once translation finishes, the new **polypeptide chain** undergoes several processes:

### 1. Folding
- The chain folds into specific **secondary** (α-helices, β-sheets) and **tertiary** structures.
- Folding is assisted by **chaperone proteins**.

### 2. Post-Translational Modifications
- Chemical changes that make the protein functional:
  - **Phosphorylation**
  - **Glycosylation**
  - **Acetylation**
  - **Cleavage of signal peptides**

### 3. Targeting
- Some proteins remain in the **cytoplasm**.
- Others are sent to the **endoplasmic reticulum (ER)**, **Golgi apparatus**, **lysosomes**, or exported out of the cell.

## Energy Requirement

Translation is **energy-intensive** and requires **GTP** (guanosine triphosphate) molecules during:
- **tRNA loading**
- **Binding of tRNA to ribosome**
- **Translocation**

## Key Takeaways

- Translation converts **mRNA code → amino acid sequence → functional protein**.  
- **Start codon (AUG)** signals the beginning; **stop codons (UAA, UAG, UGA)** signal the end.  
- **Ribosomes**, **tRNAs**, and **enzymes** work together in a precisely coordinated mechanism.  
- Each step is highly regulated to ensure protein accuracy and efficiency.  
- Errors in translation can cause **nonfunctional** or **toxic proteins**, leading to diseases.
