# Proteins

## What is a Protein?  
Proteins are **large, complex organic molecules** made of smaller building blocks called **amino acids**.  
They are present in all living cells and are essential for **structure, function, and regulation of biological processes**.

## Protein Structure  
Proteins have **four levels of structure**:

1. **Primary structure**  
   - The linear sequence of amino acids linked by peptide bonds.  
   - The order of amino acids determines the protein’s properties and function.  

2. **Secondary structure**  
   - Local folding patterns in the chain:  
     - **Alpha-helix (α-helix)**  
     - **Beta-pleated sheet (β-sheet)**  

3. **Tertiary structure**  
   - The full three-dimensional shape of a single polypeptide chain.  
   - Stabilized by hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, hydrophobic interactions, and disulfide bridges.  

4. **Quaternary structure**  
   - Association of multiple polypeptide chains (subunits).  
   - Example: **Hemoglobin** (made of 4 subunits).
