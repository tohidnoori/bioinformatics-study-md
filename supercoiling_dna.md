# Superhelix (Supercoiling) Structure of Chromosomes  ⚙️

## What Is It?  
The **superhelix** (or **supercoiling**) structure refers to the **further twisting and coiling** of the DNA double helix so it can **fit inside the cell nucleus**.  
Even though the DNA molecule is extremely long, this supercoiling allows it to be packed **compactly** while still remaining **functional**.

## Levels of DNA Packing (from simplest to most complex)

### 1. **DNA Double Helix (2 nm wide)**  
- The basic structure: two strands of nucleotides wound into a double helix.


### 2. **Nucleosomes (10 nm fiber)**  
- DNA wraps around **histone proteins** (8 histones per nucleosome).  
- Each "bead" = a nucleosome.  
- DNA wraps about **1.65 turns (~147 base pairs)** around each histone core.

### 3. **Chromatin Fiber (30 nm fiber)**  
- Nucleosomes coil together to form a **solenoid** or **zigzag** pattern.  
- This fiber is thicker and more compact.

### 4. **Looped Domains (300 nm)**  
- The 30 nm fiber forms **loops** attached to a protein scaffold.  
- These loops bring distant parts of DNA close together, important for gene regulation.

### 5. **Supercoiling (Superhelix Formation)**  
- The loops and fibers **coil even further**, forming **superhelices**.  
- This level of coiling gives chromosomes their **dense and organized** structure, especially visible during cell division.

### 6. **Metaphase Chromosome (700–1400 nm)**  
- The most condensed state of DNA during **mitosis**.  
- Each chromosome consists of two **sister chromatids** joined at a **centromere**.

## Enzymes Involved in Supercoiling  

- **Topoisomerase I & II (DNA Gyrase)**  
  - Control the level of supercoiling.  
  - Can **cut and rejoin DNA strands** to relieve or introduce supercoils.  
  - Maintain proper DNA tension during replication and transcription.
