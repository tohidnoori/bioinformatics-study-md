## What is DNA?  
DNA is the **genetic blueprint of life**. It contains instructions for making proteins and regulating cellular activities.  
- Located mainly in the **nucleus** of eukaryotic cells.  
- Also found in mitochondria and chloroplasts.

### Functions of DNA  
1. **Store genetic information**  
2. **Replication** before cell division  
3. **Code for proteins** (via transcription ‚Üí translation)  
4. **Transmit hereditary traits**  
### Structure of DNA  

#### 1. Nucleotides (Building Blocks)  
Each nucleotide has three parts:  
- **Phosphate group (PO‚ÇÑ¬≥‚Åª)**  
- **Deoxyribose sugar** (5-carbon sugar)  
- **Nitrogenous base**: Adenine (A), Thymine (T), Cytosine (C), Guanine (G)  

#### 2. Nitrogenous Bases  
- **Purines (2 rings):** Adenine (A), Guanine (G)  
- **Pyrimidines (1 ring):** Cytosine (C), Thymine (T)  

**Base-pairing rules (Chargaff‚Äôs Rule):**  
- A pairs with T (2 hydrogen bonds)  
- G pairs with C (3 hydrogen bonds)
