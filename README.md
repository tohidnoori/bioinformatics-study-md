#  Introduction to Biology for Bioinformatics ðŸ§  ðŸ§¬

Welcome to the **Biology Foundations** section of the Bioinformatics series.  
Before diving into algorithms, data analysis, or genomics pipelines, itâ€™s essential to understand the **biological principles** that form the basis of bioinformatics.

This section covers the key molecular and cellular concepts â€” DNA, RNA, proteins, and gene expression â€” which will help you interpret biological data with confidence.

## Topics Covered

1. [**DNA**](./DNA.md)  
   Structure, composition, and the role of DNA as the genetic blueprint of life.

2. [**Supercoiling of DNA**](./supercoiling_dna.md)  
   Understanding DNA topology and why supercoiling matters in replication and transcription.

3. [**Genes**](./gene.md)  
   What genes are, how theyâ€™re organized, and their relationship to traits and functions.

4. [**RNA**](./rna.md)  
   Types of RNA and their crucial roles in gene expression.

5. [**RNA-Related Topics**](./rna-topic.md)  
   Extended discussions on RNA processing, splicing, and regulatory RNAs.

6. [**Transcription**](./transcription.md)  
   How genetic information in DNA is transcribed into RNA.

7. [**Translation**](./translation.md)  
   The process of decoding RNA to synthesize proteins.

8. [**Proteins**](./Proteins.md)  
   Structure, function, and importance of proteins in cellular life.

9. [**Amino Acids**](./amino_acids.md)  
   The building blocks of proteins â€” chemical properties and classifications.

10. [**Cell Differentiation**](./cell-differentiation.md)  
    How cells develop specialized functions despite having the same DNA.
