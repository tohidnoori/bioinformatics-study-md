# Proteins

## What is a Protein?  
Proteins are **large, complex organic molecules** made of smaller building blocks called  **[amino acids](./amino_acids.md)**.  
They are present in all living cells and are essential for **structure, function, and regulation of biological processes**.

## Protein Structure  
Proteins have **four levels of structure**:

1. **Primary structure**  
   - The linear sequence of amino acids linked by ```peptide bonds```.  
   - The order of amino acids determines the protein’s properties and function.  

2. **[Secondary structure](./Proteins.md#what-is-secondary-structure)**  
   - **Alpha-helix (α-helix)**  
   - **Beta-pleated sheet (β-sheet)**  

3. **Tertiary structure**  
   - The full three-dimensional shape of a single polypeptide chain.  
   - Stabilized by hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, hydrophobic interactions, and disulfide bridges.  

4. **Quaternary structure**  
   - Association of multiple polypeptide chains (subunits).  
   - Example: **Hemoglobin** (made of 4 subunits).

## Composition of the Polypeptide Backbone  
Each amino acid has three main parts:  
1. **Amino group (–NH₂)**  
2. **Carboxyl group (–COOH)**  
3. **Side chain (R group)** ← This part is different for each amino acid.  

**Peptide bond:**  A peptide bond is a type of covalent bond that joins two amino acids to form a protein chain.

**Polypeptide Backbone:**
When amino acids are joined together by **peptide bonds**, they form a chain called a **polypeptide**.  
Within this chain, there is a repeating and consistent sequence of atoms called the **polypeptide backbone**.  


**When peptide bonds form:** 
- The amino group of one amino acid reacts with the carboxyl group of another.  
- Water (H₂O) is released, and a covalent **peptide bond** is created.

## What is Secondary Structure?
After amino acids join into a polypeptide chain, the **backbone** can fold into regular patterns, stabilized by **hydrogen bonds** between backbone atoms.  

The two most common secondary structures are:  
- **Alpha helix (α-helix)**  
- **Beta sheet (β-sheet)**  

#### Alpha Helix (α-helix)  
- Shape: **Right-handed spiral** of the polypeptide backbone.  
- Stabilization: **Hydrogen bonds** between  
  - the carbonyl oxygen (C=O) of one amino acid  
  - and the amide hydrogen (N–H) of an amino acid **4 residues away**.  
- R groups (side chains) project outward from the helix.  


#### Beta Sheet (β-sheet)  
- Shape: **Extended, sheet-like arrangement** of strands.  
- Stabilization: Hydrogen bonds between backbone atoms of **neighboring strands**.  
- Two types:  
  - **Parallel**: strands run in the same direction.  
  - **Antiparallel**: strands run in opposite directions (more stable).  
- R groups alternate above and below the sheet.  

#### Summary  
- **α-helix** = spiral stabilized by H-bonds every 4 residues.  
- **β-sheet** = sheet stabilized by H-bonds between strands.  
- Both are crucial for protein folding and stability.

## Protein Switching: ON and OFF States   
#### 1. **Covalent Modification**  
- Proteins can be chemically modified to switch between active/inactive states.  
- Most common example:  
  - **Phosphorylation**: addition of a phosphate group → may activate or inactivate the protein.  
  - **Dephosphorylation**: removal of a phosphate group → reverses the effect.  

#### 2. **Ligand Binding**  
- A protein changes shape when a **ligand (small molecule)** binds to it.  
- This structural change can turn the protein **ON or OFF**.  
- Example: Hemoglobin binds oxygen → changes activity.  

#### 3. **Conformational Change**  
- Some proteins switch states simply by altering their **3D shape**.  
- Example: Ion channels in membranes open (ON) or close (OFF) depending on shape.  

#### 4. **Protein–Protein Interactions**  
- Proteins may only work when they bind to another protein.  
- Example: Enzyme complexes form when multiple proteins come together.  

#### Importance  
- Prevents wasting energy by keeping proteins OFF when not needed.  
- Ensures proteins are active **only at the right time**.  
- Critical for processes like:  
  - Enzyme activity regulation  
  - Cell signaling  
  - Preventing diseases such as **cancer** (where proteins can get stuck ON).
