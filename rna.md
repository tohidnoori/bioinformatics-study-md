# RNA

## Overview
**RNA (Ribonucleic Acid)** is a **single-stranded nucleic acid** made from **nucleotides** — just like DNA.  
It plays a **central role in gene expression**, acting as the **bridge between DNA and proteins**.

You can think of RNA as the **active copy** or **messenger** of genetic information that helps the cell build proteins and regulate genes.

## Chemical Structure of RNA

| Feature | RNA | DNA |
|----------|-----|-----|
| Sugar | **Ribose** (has one more oxygen atom) | **Deoxyribose** |
| Strands | **Single-stranded** | **Double-stranded** |
| Nitrogen Bases | **A, U, G, C** (Adenine, Uracil, Guanine, Cytosine) | **A, T, G, C** (Adenine, Thymine, Guanine, Cytosine) |
| Base pairing | A–U, G–C | A–T, G–C |
| Stability | Less stable | More stable |

### Explanation
- RNA’s sugar, **ribose**, has a hydroxyl group (–OH) on the 2′ carbon, making RNA **more reactive** and **less stable** than DNA.
- **Uracil (U)** replaces **Thymine (T)** in RNA.
- Because it’s **single-stranded**, RNA can **fold into complex 3D shapes**, giving it many **functional roles**, not just information storage.

## RNA Nucleotides
Each RNA nucleotide has 3 parts:
1. **Ribose sugar**
2. **Phosphate group**
3. **Nitrogenous base (A, U, G, or C)**

When nucleotides link together by **phosphodiester bonds**, they form the RNA strand.

## Major Types of RNA and Their Functions

There are **three main types** of RNA directly involved in protein synthesis and **several others** that regulate gene expression and RNA processing.
### 1. Messenger RNA (mRNA)
- **Function:** Carries genetic instructions from **DNA** in the nucleus to **ribosomes** in the cytoplasm.  
- **Produced by:** **Transcription**.  
- **Structure:** Linear; contains codons (triplets of bases) that specify amino acids.  
- **Example:** If the DNA has a sequence `TAC GAA CTT`, the mRNA will be `AUG CUU GAA`.  
  This mRNA is then **translated into a protein**.


### 2. Transfer RNA (tRNA)
- **Function:** Brings **amino acids** to the ribosome during **translation**.
- **Structure:** Cloverleaf shape; has:
  - An **anticodon** region (pairs with mRNA codon).
  - An **amino acid binding site** on the opposite end.
- **Role:** Acts as a **translator** between mRNA language (nucleotides) and protein language (amino acids).

Example:  
If mRNA codon = **AUG**,  
tRNA anticodon = **UAC**,  
and it carries the amino acid **methionine**.


### 3. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA)
- **Function:** Forms part of the **ribosome**, the molecular machine that builds proteins.  
- **Structure:** Combines with proteins to make the **large and small subunits** of a ribosome.  
- **Role:** Catalyzes the formation of **peptide bonds** between amino acids — so it acts like an **enzyme (ribozyme)**.


## Other Important RNAs (Regulatory and Structural)

| RNA Type | Function |
|-----------|-----------|
| **snRNA (Small nuclear RNA)** | Involved in **RNA splicing** (removes introns from pre-mRNA). |
| **snoRNA (Small nucleolar RNA)** | Helps **modify rRNA** inside the nucleolus. |
| **miRNA (Micro RNA)** | **Regulates gene expression** by binding to mRNA and preventing translation. |
| **siRNA (Small interfering RNA)** | Involved in **RNA interference (RNAi)** — silences specific genes. |
| **lncRNA (Long non-coding RNA)** | Plays **regulatory roles** in chromatin structure and transcription. |

## RNA Synthesis — Transcription Recap
RNA is made by **RNA polymerase** during **transcription**:
1. RNA polymerase binds to DNA promoter.
2. Unwinds the DNA helix.
3. Builds a complementary RNA strand using one DNA strand as a **template**.
4. The RNA is released and (in eukaryotes) processed into mature form.

## RNA Folding and Function
Because RNA is single-stranded, it can **fold back on itself** and form **hydrogen bonds** between complementary bases.

This allows RNA to:
- Form **secondary structures** (hairpins, loops).
- Act as **enzymes (ribozymes)**.
- Participate in **self-regulation** and **splicing**.

## Key Biological Roles of RNA

| Role | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **Genetic messenger** | mRNA carries DNA information to ribosomes. |
| **Translator** | tRNA matches amino acids to codons. |
| **Catalyst** | rRNA catalyzes peptide bond formation. |
| **Regulator** | miRNA and siRNA control which genes are turned on or off. |
| **Structural** | rRNA and lncRNA help maintain cellular structure. |

## RNA World Hypothesis
Many scientists believe that **RNA was the first genetic material** in early life forms because:
- RNA can **store information** (like DNA).
- RNA can **catalyze reactions** (like proteins).
This idea is called the **RNA World Hypothesis** — suggesting life may have started with self-replicating RNA molecules.
